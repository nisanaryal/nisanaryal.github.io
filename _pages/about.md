Hi, I'm Nisan Aryal, an AI Engineer specializing in Computer Vision and Medical Imaging. My expertise encompasses various domains, including image classification, segmentation, object detection, audio classification, and speech enhancement. I'm particularly intrigued by Generative AI, 3D reconstruction, and multi-model AI applications. 
Currently, I'm applying my expertise and enthusiasm as an AI Engineer at [MTEG](http://mteg.co.kr/en/), where I'm at the forefront of advancing artificial intelligence. In my current role, I'm immersed in the medical domain, with a particular focus on surgical tools detection and surgical phase estimation.
